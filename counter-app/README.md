# Counter App

A simple counter application built with React and styled-components.

## Description

This Counter App allows users to increment, decrement, and reset a counter value.
The increment button increases the counter value by 1, the decrement button decreases it by 1, and the reset button sets the counter back to 0.
The buttons have been styled to disable when certain conditions are met (e.g., decrement and reset buttons are disabled when the counter is 0, increment button is disabled when the counter is 20).

## Features

- Increment the counter value.
- Decrement the counter value.
- Reset the counter value to 0.
- Styled buttons with hover effects and disabled states.
- The counter value cannot go below 0 or above 20.
